# Computer and Network Security

## CTIS-496: Computer and Network Security Class Project (Part 1 - Part 2 - Part 3):

### Part 1: Focuses on OpenPGP-based secure communication using GPG, Thunderbird, and public keyservers
##### Key Tasks
- Generating PGP key pairs (RSA, 4096 bits) for secure email.
- Importing/exporting public and private keys using GPG and Thunderbird.
- Uploading public keys to a public keyserver and verifying key fingerprints.
- Sending encrypted and digitally signed emails via Thunderbird.
- Creating and verifying digital signatures for files using GPG.
- Managing key trust levels and signing each otherâ€™s public keys.
- Verifying software authenticity using signature files and GPG.

### Part 2: Focuses on public key infrastructure (PKI) and secure email communication using tools like Thunderbird, OpenSSL, and X.509 certificates.
##### Key Tasks
- Obtaining and managing S/MIME certificates from Actalis.
- Configuring secure email accounts with encryption and digital signatures.
- Extracting public certificates and working with PEM, P12 formats.
- Inspecting web server certificates via OpenSSL.
- Analyzing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
- Creating and inspecting self-signed certificates, or completing advanced SEED Labs on PKI.

### Part 3: Applied cryptanalysis, image encryption, and secure coding standards
##### Key Tasks Performed hand-based cryptanalysis of the Affine Cipher, including manual key recovery through algebraic equations.

- Solving Affine cipher challenges using manual key recovery.
- Creating and encrypting substitution ciphers with custom keys.
- Applying known plaintext attacks on permutation ciphers to find candidate keys.
- Encrypting images with AES-128 in ECB and CBC modes using OpenSSL and GIMP.
- Comparing visual differences in encryption modes through image analysis.
- Documenting encryption steps using basic Linux/Unix commands.
- Writing and commenting secure code based on SEI CERT coding standards.
